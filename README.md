# ChatWithFuncs

This is the simplest Python program I could think of that demonstrated how to use functions with gpt in a chat application.

You'll need API keys to two services to run this application.

1. OpenAI, which offers a limited amount of free usage for new users but is otherwise quite cheap.
2. Twelve Data (https://twelvedata.com/) which offers a free, low volume account

Program expects two environment variables to be set:

OPENAI_API_KEY

and

TWELVE_API_KEY

(obviously to the API keys from your accounts)
